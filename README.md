# glsmac-demo-mod

This mod will demonstrate how to use GLSMAC's scripting engine to modify original game behavior.

It will start small but I'll keep adding things as GLSMAC gets more features, to show how things can be done.

You can use this mod as base and/or reference for creation of your own mods.

There is no versioning yet but most of the time latest version of this mod will work with latest 'stable' version of GLSMAC.

### Quickstart

1) Clone or download and unpack it to `GLSMAC_data/mods`, so path should be `<glsmac_location>/GLSMAC_data/mods/glsmac-demo-mod`

2) Run GLSMAC with `--mods glsmac-demo-mod` (add to command line or to shortcut properties). To save time, also add `--quickstart --quickstart-faction DEMOCOLLECTIVE`
